📌 Project Title:
Secure Data Hiding in Image Using Steganography

📖 Overview
This project demonstrates a simple yet effective way to hide secret messages inside images using steganography. By modifying pixel values, the hidden data remains undetectable to the human eye, ensuring secure communication and data privacy. A passcode is required to retrieve the embedded message, adding an extra layer of security.

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used
Python – Programming language
OpenCV (cv2) – For image processing
OS Module (os) – To open encrypted images
String Manipulation – For character encoding (if needed)

🚀 Features
✅ Pixel-based data hiding – Secret messages are embedded into image pixels.
✅ Passcode-protected decryption – Only authorized users can retrieve the hidden message.
✅ Minimal image distortion – The image remains visually unchanged after data embedding.
✅ Lightweight & efficient – Uses only OpenCV and built-in Python libraries.
✅ Secure data transmission – Helps in private communication and data protection.

🔧 How to Run the Project
1️⃣ Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python installed along with OpenCV.
2️⃣ Run the Script
3️⃣ Enter the Secret Message:
The script will prompt you to enter a message to hide inside the image.
It will also ask for a passcode to secure the message.
4️⃣ Decryption Process:
When prompted, enter the correct passcode to retrieve the hidden message.
